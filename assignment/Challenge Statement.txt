CEN3031 Summer 2025 Challenge Statement
Section 16799
Lead TA: Tomisin Obajemu & Mansi Pai
University students face a unique set of challenges and opportunities as they navigate academic
responsibilities, social connections, personal development, and future planning. For this project,
your task is to design a software application that supports university students in a meaningful and
practical way. This could involve enhancing academic performance, improving mental or
physical well-being, fostering peer connections, helping with career preparation, or addressing
common pain points like time management, resource access, or financial stress. Your solution
should be guided by a clear understanding of the specific needs, habits, and pressures faced by
students in a university environment.
The application you develop should provide interactive features that deliver real value to
students’ lives. You can create something that will be of use to university students generically or
design something that caters to the needs of a specific sub-group. Your solution must go beyond
offering static information or replicating existing systems; a simple landing page or a visual
representation of a database will not be sufficient. Think carefully about what success and
support mean in the context of student life and design a solution that is not only functional, but
also engaging and sustainable for real-world use.
While this system is not required to be developed to be accessed via the web, it must be able to
be run on multiple different machines while accessing a central database (you will run a database
locally for testing and development, but it should function as if you were connecting to a
database on a central server).
Course Specifications:
● Implements user authentication with at least two distinct user types (e.g., administrator
and member)
● Implements a dynamic database of user and item data
● Implements one or more “operations” involving some form of frontend-backend-database
communication
Course Expectations:
● Databases can use any existing dataset or have dummy data. Databases using datasets
should have at least 100 items. There can be exceptions based on the specific project.
● New user creation/registration should be available
● UI design should contain elements commonly found or expected such as a user profile,
login, logout.
● Consideration for design aesthetics
● System should be dynamic and responsive
